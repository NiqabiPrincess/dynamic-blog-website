# dynamic-blog-website-
my web development class assignment 3 

For my project, I'm building a blog website with some core features. The main page will show a list of blog posts, with each post displaying its title, date, and a short preview that links to the full post. There’s also a page where I can create new posts by filling out a form with the title and content. Plus, I’ve added functionality to edit or delete existing posts, so I can easily update or remove content as needed.
